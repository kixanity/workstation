Routing Tables
	> when setting up routers and switches, the first thing we need to examine are routing tables
	routing tables allow a router to discover what the best path is to send packets 
	and can be used to modify settings via the administrative portal on a router or on a particular cable
	remember STP to keep multiple routers from forming loops

Dynamic
	> automatically find routes using different protocols
	IGP - RIP/v2, OSPF, IGRP, EIGRP
	EGP - BGP
Static
	> set particular routes
	can set ‘default static route’

Network Address Translation (NAT)
	> allows a private IP address to be translated to a public address and vice versa
	allows external users to access internet

	Static NAT > one private is to one public
	Dynamic NAT > maps addresses from
	Overloading NAT > port address translation (PAT)
	
	Local	> happens on the inside of your network.
	Global	> happens on the outside of your network.

	Inside Local Address
		> address of a host on your internal network
		Private IP address that is being translated into public IP address
	Inside Global Address
		> This is the mapped address that people on the Internet would see, which represents the inside host
		The public IP that the private IP address is being traslated in to
	Outside Global Address
		> The IP address of a remote Internet-based host as assigned by the owner that can communicate with an inside host
		The destination's/outside's public IP address
	Outside Local Address
		> This is the address that the inside hosts use to reference an outside host
		The outside local address may be the outside host’s actual address or another translated private address from a different private address block
		The destination's/outside's private IP address

Port Address Translation (PAT)
	>overloading NAT
	gives us the ability to map multiple IP addresses to a single public IP address
	translation is done in the basis of IP address and port

Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN)
	> allows us to take the infrastructure for one local area network
	make multiple virtual local networks which helps to segment different broadcast domains
	requires use of managed switches
	they cannot talk to each other unless it’s via a router
		Port Based
		MAC Address based
		Subnet Based
	Trunking
		connection between switches
		connect multiple VLANs

VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP)
	> is a Cisco proprietary protocol that propagates the definition of Virtual Local Area Networks on the whole local area network
	> Setup switches
		VTP Domain
		VTP Protocol
		VTP Password
	
Switches:
	Managed
		> offers additional control of data flow and configurations
		they are accessed via a default web interface with a username and password
		or special cable
	Unmanaged
		> No web interface
		plug and play
		just let connections run
		No additional functionality
		managed switch may have a button to swap from

Interface configurations:
	Full duplex	> both directions simultaneously
	Half duplex	> one at a time
	Port speeds	> 10/100/1000mbps
	IP addressing
	MAC filtering


Power over Internet (POE)
	> useful for devices that need to be powered over a single standard Ethernet cable such as VOiP phones
	cable provides data and power

Traffic Filtering
	> allows the router to inspect different packets
	can be filtered by IP address and packet types
	router acts like a firewall

Diagnostics
	> additional info.logs
	stats and usage info
	collisions and errors
	may install additional software

Quality of Service
	> prioritizes certain packets
	packets susceptible to delay give more weight


Port Mirroring
	> aka Switch Port Analyzer (SPAN)
	allows devices to see copies of the data that’s going through a switch
	configure port to receive copy of data
	capture and analyze packets
	place an IDS (IPS not useful here)
	set up devices to capture data
	devices on mirrored ports cant talk
