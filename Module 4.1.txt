Appliances

Load Balancer - distributes the workload
Proxy Server - privacy/caching
Content Filter - protection blocking
VPN Concentrator - connects externally

Load Balancer
	> used to distribute the workload across devices
	load balancers transparently distribute
	transparently distribute using algorithms
	
		Round robin > 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4
		
		Weighted round robin > 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1

		Fastest response time > whatever server response first, it will get the request

		Least connection > fewest queueing

	also capable of DOS protection and caching

		DOS attack > (e.g. when someone is trying to bring down/hack/find a vulnerability to a site by sending high volume/millions of send requests at once,
		now it will get too many requests until it cant handle all those request and try to deny others of service,
		then noticed it came from the same MAC address a load balancer will drop the packets)
	
		caching	> (e.g. too much requested webpage will be saved so it doesnt have to pass others some workload)


Proxy Server
	> goes for us on our behalf
	work in between our computers and the Internet
	intentional man in the middle
	pc to proxy server then internet
	
	additional privacy > the endpoint sees the proxy as the one whos connected to them rather than us
				requests a decoy ip address
	
	content filtering > if some contents/keywords/websites are not allowed to be browsed then proxy server will drop those requests

	increased performance (caching) > if two computers sends the same request then it send the other one response from the proxy server cache
					caching websites that viewed alot


Content Filter
	> able block traffic based on rules and filters
	traffic needs to flow through device
	can be evaluated in different ways such as keywords in the URL or the category of web sites
	many different environments
	Content filters can be used in many different environments such as parental controls
	office productivity to prevent employees from spending too much time on certain web sites
	Content filters can be hardware, software or cloud-based

VPN Concentrator
	> provides a connection point for remote users
	adds the capabilities of a VPN router by adding advanced data and network security to the communications
	has the ability to create and manage a large quantity of VPN tunnel
	initiate the VPN client and connects to the public Internet

	end users initiate VPN client
	connect to public internet
	encrypted tunnel to VPN concentrator
	concentrator authenticates

	laptop (encrypt / vpn client) > internet > concentrator ( decrpyt) > work
	work > concentrator (encrypt ) > internet > laptop ( decrpyt )

	data flows through the encrypted tunnel to the concentrator and then the concentrator authenticates
	provides encryption and prevents remote access servcie exposure
	capable of standing alone or implementing into the edge router
