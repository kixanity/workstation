Network Performance Optimization

it is important to assess a system for latency sensitivity
Certain services are most sensitive to latency such as VoIP, video and RDP

Latency sensitivity
	> service is affected by a slow connection
	methods for optimizing the network to help with latency sensitivity
	certain services are more susceptible to latency
	VoIP, video, remote desktop
	such as when a video pauses to buffer
	long delay during a Skype call

High bandwidth 
	> applications might be latency sensitive but they use a lot of network traffic
	need to be watched applications (data capacity)
	Services such as video and music streaming
	file hosting or file sharing
	cloud applications take up a lot of room on the network


Quality of Service (QoS)
	> helps to ensure priority of latency sensitive packets
	can be built into network devices

Traffic shaping
	> can delay less important traffic
	makes the most of available bandwidth
	might be on the user end or on the ISP

Load Balancing
	> a method that distributes the workload across multiple devices
	be as transparent as possible
	allows for a high functioning system in that it has the least connections with the fastest response time
		
		round robin
		least connections
		fastest response time
		weighted round robin

Uptime
	> the time services are available
	Needs can vary and a certain percentage of uptime is included in the Standard Lease Agreement (SLA)
	strong uptime is needed so people are able to use the network to work and accomplish their tasks
	A strong uptime consists of the following components:
		Redundancy
		Power backup
		Secondary Internet
		Backup sites

Methods which are necessary to maintain a high uptime in a network

High Availability
	> used to calculate allowed downtime and allow for high uptime
	based on a businessâ€™ needs and the Standard Lease Agreement (SLA)
	measured in percentages and shows the amount of time a network is available

		90%		36.5 days/year		16.8 hours/week
		99%		3.6 days/year		5.04 hours/week
		99.9%		8.76 hours/week		10.1 minutes/week

Caching Engines
	> allows a network at different points to save frequently used resources so they are available when needed
	results in improved connection speeds
	reduce strain
	load balancer, proxy server, local cache, etc

Fault Tolerance
	> essentially the act of having fail over devices available
	preferably thee devices are automatic such as 
		routers, switches and cables
		ups, data backups, cold/warm/hot sites

Common Access Redundancy Protocol (CARP)
	>  allows multiple hosts on the same local area network to share a set of IP addresses
	primary purpose is to provide failover redundancy, especially when used with firewalls and routers
	multiple hosts share the IP
	allows for transparent fault tolerance
	each device has a shared IP and personal management IP
	can be fail over or load balance
