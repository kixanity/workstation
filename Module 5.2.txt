Access Control List (ACL)

Media access control (MAC) filtering
	> based on MAC address
	manually record/set rules
	can be spoofed

IP filtering
	> filter by IP
	set static/reservations
	can be spoofed

Port filtering
	> port ACL filter ingress and/or egress traffic on certain port
	access ports/trunk ports
	utilize MAC/IP filtering
	disable unused ports
	layer 2/3


Tunneling

Virtual Private Network (VPN)
	> encrypted private tunnel over a public network
	creating a private network on a public interface
	tunneled/encrypted connection over a public network
	can essentially be on a private network
	
	Client to Site
		remote access VPN
		may utilize speacial client software

	Site to Site
		connect two sites (e.g. businesses)
		cheaper than leased line
		persistent or dial on demand

	
Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
	> web browser based VPN (HTTPS)
	uses certificate for manual authentication
 

Transport Layer Security (TLS)
	> more common HTTPS
	certificates

Transport Layer Security 2 (TLS2)
	> enhanced security, hashing checks

Peer to Peer Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)
	> Older dialup protocol
	adds client on virtual node
	has weak encryption/hashing
	not recommended

Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol
	> carries layer 2 traffic
	no encryption by itself but utilizes IPsec, RADIUS and TACAS +
