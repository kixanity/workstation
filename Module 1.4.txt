Routing/Switching
	Allows for connecting devices
	Switching (same network)	
	Routing (different network)

Hubs
	> receive data then sends to everyone except to the one who sends it to it
	computers decide to accept/reject

Switches
	> ‘smart’ hub
	tracks MAC (port)

Multilayers
	> can perform routing and switching
	layers 2 & 3

Bridges
	> connects network segments
	breaks up and segments traffic
	layer 2
	
  
Repeaters
	> increase signals 
	amplify (power) 
	regenerate (clean)

Routers
	> move data across different networks
	segmentation/subnetting
	manage traffic flow

	in order for a router to know where to go next, 
	it must have a table to send data too and allows for data to be sent outside of the network	
	
	> manage tables
	send data where?
	static vs dynamic
	protocols, eigrp, ospf
	
	> default gateway
	router only addresses direct packets
	set to send to unknown destination

Routing Tables
	> where to pass on data
	destination network IP/SM
	nxt router to get there
	number of ‘hops’
	protocols help determine fastest path
	


Route Print
	> view computer routing table



Routing Metrics
	> qualities used to determine best path

Hop Count (tracert)
	> how many other routers does a signal need to pass?

Maximum transmission Unit (MTU)
	> maximum size of a single packet we can send

Casts
	> reliability

Latency
	> amount of delay we have on a link.

Link State
	> cost-based protocol
	best path (fastest)
	multiplefactors (distance, speed, etc)
	i.e. 	Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), 
		Intermediate System-Intermediate System (IS-IS)

Distance Vector
	> based on the number of ‘hops’
	uses # of hops
	routing by rumor
	exchange of routing tables
	rip v ripv2

Hybrid
	> mixture of distance vector and link state
	uses ‘hop’ count and cost

IGP (Interior Gateway Protocol)
	> inside autonomous network

	RIP (Routing Information Protocol)
		> distance vector (hop)
		no more than 15 hops
		no classless

	RIPv2
		> more hops
		supports classless

	OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
		> most used IGP
		link state analysis (cost)
		supports classless

	IGRP (Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)
		> CISCO distance vector (hop)
		more hops than RIP
		no classless

	EIGRP (Enhanced IGRP)
		> CISCO hybrid (hop and cost)
		supports classless

	IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System)
		> just like BGP but part of IGP
		used for routing between autonomous system

EGP (Exterior Gateway Protocol)
	> used for connecting external networks and routers
	
	utilizes BGP

	BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)
		> path vector protocol
		similar to distance vector except only one ‘speaker’ node for domain
		which reduces traffic and helps manage information sent out over the exterior


Dynamic Routing Tables
	> routing table can be static or dynamic
	static routing table requires information to be manually entered by hand
	dynamic routing automatically finds the best route
	dynamic routing uses either IGP or EGP

Convergence (steady state)
	> when all of the routers have all of the same topology information/routing information
	routers are communicating with each other and they all have the same ideas on how to get to a particular server
	network routing ‘nirvana’
	occurs at different rates
	i.e.	network size
		type of routing protocol
		hardware/device problems


Spanning Tree Protocol
	> bridge connect network segment
	can cause loops during broadcast
	prevents a packet from doing an endless loop in a network
	sends out a packet that lets spanning tree protocol know not to send data on certain links
	certain bridge can block off its link to other bridges which prevents loops
	turning certain links to blocking mode
	most direct path may not be used 
	when devices go offline other links will be unblocked


Broadcast Domain
	> an area of a network where a broadcasted message can reach and are all the devices in a network 
	that can be reached at OSI Layer 2 and it anywhere that a link does not pass through a router
	> all nodes can reach each other by broadcast at the data link layer
	> a domain in which a broadcast is forwarded
	> routers don’t forward broadcasts from one broadcast domain to another

Collision Domain 
	>  involve two devices trying to communicate simultaneously and therefore creating data collisions
	> can happen on links connected to devices as well as devices connected to a hub
	> occurs when more than one device attempts to send a packet on a network segment at the same time
	> packets collide and both devices must send the packets again, which reduces network efficiency


Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs IEEE 802.1Q)
	> allow us to segment a large network
	help to segment large networks
	cut down on traffic on make networks a bit more secure
	broadcasts go to the same VLAN and are composed of two major port types

	Access Ports
		> allow us to connect devices in one particular VLAN to a switch (device to switch)
	Trunk Ports
		> allows us to connect different switches to multiple VLANS (switch to switch)

	filter with different criteria depending on how they’re configured
		> Physical Port (manual)
		> MAC Addresses
		> Sub netting IP Addresses

Port Mirroring
	> aka SPAN Port (Switch Port ANalyzer)
	configure port to have all data mirrored to it
	captures network data
	devices can't talk on this port (unless a second NIC is set)

		IPS > switch and firewall
