Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
	> provides automatic IP addressing, subnet mask and default gateways
	functions on broadcast which only goes to devices and components within a specific broadcast domain so they won’t propagate over a router
	device to hand out addresses
	NIC to ‘obtain address auto’
	It is important to remember there is also an APIPA address
	APIPA stands for Automatic Private Internet Protocol Addressing
	This is what we will get on a client if DHCP fails to give us an IP address

	DHCP Process
		Discover > Offer > Request > Ack

Static
	access devices should be static
	statch devices can be on DHCP
	create reservation

Dynamic
	set ranger (scope)
	set lease
	When an address is given out DHCP, they are only good for a finite period
	DHCP servers allow us to lease a period of time that an IP address is good for

Reservations
	> settings on a DHCP server which reserves a specific IP address for a device with a specific MAC address

Scopes
	> discover a range of IP addresses that the DHCP server will give out
	not all addresses must be set
	80/20 rule: Multiple DHCP servers

Leases
	> how long IP addresses are good for
	lease can be renewed and extended if the address is still available
	devices attempt renewal after 87.5% of lease
	
	Renewal process
		client asks for renewal
		dhcp either extends lease or no response
