###Appropriate hardware tools to troubleshoot network productivity

Cable testers 
	> verify connection and the correct pin out
	may have a remote tester

Toner probes 
	> trace wire and cable
	generator produces tone and the probe listens for tone

Cable certifiers 
	> verifies bandwidth and frequency
	tests many types of cables

Butt sets 
	> Tests plain old telephone system (POT) connection
	demark to provider
	connects to line then calls looking for a signal
	Butt sets are used when installing an Internet connection

Crimper 
	> used for cable termination, but it can also be used to cut and strip cables
	can be used on Ethernet, coaxial and fiber cables
	can also correct terminating ends and wire sequence
	When setting up and crimping a cable, leave as little excess as possible outside the connector as that can cause interference

Punch down tool 
	> can terminate connection into a block or patch panel or a keystone
	When using this tool, be careful of the blade size and the cutting edge as different size tools are meant for different size cables

Protocol Analyzer
	> used to plug into the network and analyze the traffic
	a hardware device and it can be installed on a laptop or it can be a stand-alone device (wireshark)
	It is like being able to look inside a wire and see whatâ€™s going on

Loop Back Plug
	> a device that sends cables back
	uses software to compare sent and received signals

Time domain reflectometer (TDR)
	> device which sends signals and listens to reflections back
	estimate cable length
	find cable faults and splices
	(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrjKAssUN2c)

Optical time domain reflectometer (OTDR)
	> TDR used for fiber

Multimeter 
	> measures electricity for resistance, current, voltage and continuity

Environmental monitor
	> monitors the environment for humidity, temperature and air particles (dust level)
