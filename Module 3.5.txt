Network Categories

Local Area Network (LAN)
	> these tend to be inside offices and schools
	limited geographic area
Wide Area Network (WAN)
	> multiple local area networks
	internet
Personal Area Network (PAN)
	> Bluetooth and Infared
Metro Area Network (MAN)
	> located in a college or city
	cables/wiMAX
	

Peer to Peer
	> a network in which clients talk to clients
	they share files and folders
	easy to set up and install but has limited scale/performance

Client Server
	> allows clients to be connected through a server and it is seen in the domain
	initial set up of a client server is harder,
	however it’s more scaleable and provides for better performance


Point to Point
	> one device is connected to another device
	sometimes referred to as ‘on link’

Point to Multipoint
	> when single point goes to multiple points and is used in multicasting
	signals are sent to everyone who is connected
	this can pose a security threat as it can allow for one user to sniff out the traffic that is happening on the hub


Network Topologies
	> A topology is a layout of a network both physically and logically
	the way computers are connected
	what they look like and how they send and receive data


Mesh
	> some nodes are connected to more than one node
	allows for your traffic room so more data can be passed on
	can be expensive to set up and difficult to maintain	

	fully meshed
		computers connected to more than one node
		every computer is connected to every other computer
	
	partially meshed
		some computers are connected to all the computers
		while some computers are just connected to one other computer

		still have computers that are connected to multiple other computers
		but not every computer is connected to every other computer

Ring
	> all of the nodes are connected to form a loop between them
	data is transferred using a token
		A token is a data indicating endpoint
	clears/passes/set token
	fewer collisions and allows for equal access
	one workstation down, all down
	passes data on to every computer, if one workstation gets it; they all get it

Bus
	> all of the nodes are connected to a single cable
	very common in set ups when there is a T axle on each node as well as in 10-base-5 networks
	all signals are sent using broadcast
	has the least cost and set up; it is also good for small networks
	limited length and if one node goes down, everything goes down

Star
	> all components connect to a central hub which manages all the data connections (smart or dumb)
	easy to set up and expand
	better traffic handling
	offers ease in troubleshooting
	has a single point of failure; there is no other fallback method for the devices to communicate with each other

Hybrid
	> either a mixture of two topologies: peer to peer and client to server
	also involve a mix of mesh, bus, ring and star topologies
	flexible and expandable and makes for better trouble shooting
	can be costly
	the setup is intricate and complex

Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)
	allows multiple topologies to communicate together over the same connection
	used to communicate over a backbone and transmits over a layer edge router (LER)
