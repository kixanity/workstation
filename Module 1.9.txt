Networking Virtual Computers
	> virtual computers need netwroking
	May only have one NIC
	Physical devices may be unnecessary
	Virtual switches
	Virtual VLANS
	Other virtual services

Virtual switches
	> allow us to have the same environment in a virtual environment that we would if we were using a physical switch
	and allow computers to communicate with more ease than if they were using an actual physical switch
	these switches also allow us to set up virtual local area networks while using a single NIC
	> switch like connectivity
	communicate over layer 2
	setup vlans
	utilize single NIC as trunk port

Virtual Desktops
	> allow us to have an entire virtual computer that we can connect to which allows us to access files,
	folder and different applications and be consistent with a physical environment

	Remote Desktop Virtualization
		> Virtual desktop with remote data
		Consistent folders everywhere
		Remote data execution

	Local Desktop Virtualization
		> Virtual machine runs locally
		Virtual disk/image synced
		Local resources but constant network not required

Virtual Servers
	> servers that we can virtualize that provide us with a full service so that a full physical server may not be necessary
	allows for logical distribution and scalable resources and communicate over the NIC
	may install more NICs
	may install virtual switch

Virtual Box

Private Branch Exchange (PBX)
	> a telephone switch and call manager
	Establishing connections
	Maintaining connections
	Disconnecting connections
	Providing call information
	
Virtual PBX 
	replaces hardware but still requires a call agent
	useful for Voice Over Internet (VoIP)
	works well in every environment from a small office to a large call center


ONSITE VS OFFSITE (service hosted on site or in cloud)
	Onsite
		There is faster response time and more control
		Business continuity can be affected if there are problems with the building (e.g. a power failure)
		It can be pricey to keep staff on site to work on the web server
		Staff/Training

	Off-site
		It can be more economical to manage a company web server
		Allows for business continuity in case of something like a power failure
		A great resource for backing up a lot of data
		Connectivity Delay
		Information Control

Network as a Service (NaaS)
	> allows for an offsite network
	all that is needed is a computer, a connection to an ISP
	hosts apps, data, servers, etc.
	
	Advantages
		Less in house management
		Greater business continuity and backups
		Powerful resources for less money
		Scalable
	Disadvantages
		Less control/more security concerns
		Can cost a lot
		Connectivity issues
