Network Management Tools

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)

SNMP Manager
	> data collection
	can configure devices or pull information
SNMP Agent
	> software on device use on switches, printers and servers
	can monitor or send data
SNMPv2
	> Performance improvements but complex security, not widely adopted
SNMPv3
	> The highest security, allows for username authentication
	MD5/SHA authentication
	verifying data is unchanged
	encryption


Syslog
	> allows devices to send alerts and errors to a syslog server
	Messages within the syslog specify which program logged the error, the severity of the error and the error itself
	Messages can be spoofed (some may say its okay but its not )
	can use software to parse and analyze messages (filter whats important and not)

Event Viewer
	> allows us to access logs and events
	can be viewed on local and remote computers and servers
	sort by log type or severity
	custom logs can be set up, specifics tasks can also be audited


General Logs
	> system related events to view
	application, security (e.g. someone tried to login but wrong password), system
	information, warnings, error

History Logs
	> typical of Internet browsers
	if something is not done right or maliciously
	who modified this
	additional ones can be configured
	
Traffic Analysis
	> analyzes network traffic (wireshark/firewall/IDS logs/firewall)
	some one is searching for devices/scanning ports)
	always have a baseline/reference (you might be seeing things and making assumptions on data that was always like that)
	
Protocol Analyzer
	> Analyzes traffic
	provides insight
	always run baseline
