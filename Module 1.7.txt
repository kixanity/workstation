Domain Name Services (DNS)
	allows us to resolve Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) to an IP address
	An FQDN is the name of a server, web site or device that we can access on the network
	computer speak numbers
	human remember names

	client: receives the request
	server: answers the request

The Internal DNS Server (domain controller)
	helps us find internal devices
	DNS does forward as well as reverse look ups
	reverse look up are when we look up the IP address that corresponds to the fully qualified domain name

	Dynamic Domain Name Systems (DNS)
		> auto update records
