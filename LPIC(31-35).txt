31 - Process Priorities (Nice Levels)
	$ps -alf

	nice - run a program with modified scheduling priority
		only root can set -1 to -20 niceness

		-20 not nice to cpu
		19 less cpu usage
		0 default

		$nice -10 <application>
		$nice --15 <application>

	renice - alter priority of running processes
		users can only raise nice levels
		cannot rolled back

		$renice 19 -p <process id>
		$renice -10 -p <process id>

32 - Regular Expressions with grep, egrep & fgrep
	regcomp, regexec, regerror, regfree - POSIX regex functions
	grep, egrep, fgrep, rgrep - print lines matching a pattern

	[apple]
	^ - beginning of the line
		grep ^ap

	$ - end of line
		grep le$

	. - any character missing
	a.... - any 5 characters long
		grep ..pl.
		grep ^.pp

	() - group

	| - or
		egrep '^(a|A)' at the beginning of the line lower or upper case 'A'

	[] - ranges
		egrep '^[a-m]'
			must be inside quote when in egrep
			at the beginning of the line search a to m
	
	fgrep '$$' - searches for $$
	grep $$ - doesn't show anything cause it evaluates it as a regex

33 - Basic vi usage
	---

34 - Intermediate vi usage
	/word - search forward
	?word - search backward

	:%s/word/replacement/gic
		% - whole doc
		s - substitute
		g - all occurences in every line
		i - case insensitive
		c - confirm each replacement

	dl - delete character
	d5l - 5 characters
	dw - delete word
	d3w - delete 3 words
	dd - delete line
	d4d - delete 4 lines

	yy - yank(copy) current line
	y5y - yank 5 lines
	y3w - yank 3 words
	p - paste yanked text after current line

35 - GPT and MBR
	MBR (mster boot recoed)
		$fdisk
		DOS partition
		lives on first sector
		limited to 2tb
		limited to 4 primary partitions

	GPT (GUID partition table)
		$gdisk
		stored in multiple locations on drive
		practically unlimited drive size and partition number

	BIOS
		only supports MBR (GPT itself acts like MBR)
		sees GPT as a drive with a single MBR partition

	UEFI
		native GPT support
		usually need to run in legacy mode to support MBR
