Software tools to diagnose network connectivity
Software tools can sometimes be even more informative than hardware tools when troubleshooting issues with network connectivity

Protocol analyzer
	> monitors network traffic
	computer and SPAN port (wireshark)
	analyzing network issues
	create a baseline (when network is in normal state, then compare when it is down)
	capture and analyze signals and data traffic over a communication channel

Throughput testers
	> simulates network traffic
	similar to ‘stress testers’ (testing beyond the limits of normal operation)
	simulate load through load testing
	establishes baselines

Connectivity software
	> provides continuous or period testing if a device is online
	verify systems are online
	send alerts if device is down
	deliver alerts via email
	can use ICMP echo requests (ping)


Command Line Commands

ping
	> ICMP echo request
	used to ping a system and get a response back
	ping <ip address/hostname of computer>
	linux pings until break
	windows pings 4 times

tracert (traceroute)
	> response from each gateway along the path
	shows TTL/hops to the end point
	tracks  the  route  packets taken from an IP network on their way to a given host
	can be used to discover what’s causing a ‘bottleneck’ on a network (a situation that causes delay)

ipconfig (ifconfig)
	> displays the status of the currently active interfaces
	shows generic information about our client such as the network name and which DNS servers we are connected to for a particular adapter
	all - detailed info
	flushdns - flush dns cache (when a server moved to another ip address)
	release - release lease address
	renew - renew dhcp

nslookup (dig)
	> query Internet domain name servers
	perform a DNS lookup and see what servers are providing us with a response
	nslookup <ip/dns>
	

Dig
	> linux/unix version of NSlookup

Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
	> see the MAC address to IP address correlations

Nbt stat
	> ip to dns (old)

Netstat
	> displays network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, masquerade connections, and multicast memberships

Route
	>  allows us to view and modify routing tables (such as print, add and delete)
