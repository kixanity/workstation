TCP/IP Suite
	> The TCP/IP suite is all of the different protocols all applied together so computer are able to communicate with one another across a network
	
	Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
		verified delivery to endpoint with one-to-one communication
	Internet Protocol (IP)
		delivers packets to devices and maps between logical (IP) and physical (MAC)
		routable protocol


	7	Application	FTP SSH HTTP TFTP
	6	Presentation	TLS
	5	Session		DNS
	4	Transport	TCP UDP
	3	Network		IP ICMP IGMP DHCP RIP OSPF IGRP EIGRP
	2	Data Link	ARP
	1	Physical 	NICs


Communication Protocols within the TCP/IP
	> set of rules/protocols that dictate how packets are transferred
	determine how packets are formed and sent
	how to break up data into pieces and send it where it needs to go
	layer 4

	Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
		> connection oriented protocol
		supports larger packet sizes
		numbered
		retransmission
		1 is to 1
		3 way handshake
			syn
			syn/ack
			ack
	
	User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
		>  does not need to verify a connection prior to sending data
		all about getting data to where it needs to go quickly
		small packet sizes
		connectionless
		no error recovery
		distinct chunks
		can be broadcast

	Size of Ethernet frame - 24 Bytes
	Size of IPv4 Header (without any options) - 20 bytes
	Size of TCP Header (without any options) - 20 Bytes
	So total size of empty TCP datagram - 24 + 20 + 20 = 64 bytes

	Size of UDP header - 8 bytes
	So total size of empty UDP datagram - 24 + 20 + 8 = 52 bytes


This lesson focuses on protocols that do not really have port numbers; these are network and data link protocols.

Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
	> delivers errors and queries to determine if a service is available
	doesnâ€™t really transmit information
	simply a packet of data
	ping - echo request
	traceroute

Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP)
	> multicast membership
	manages how messages go out to different computers

Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
	> allows computers to discover which IP address is associated with which physical addresses (MAC)
	helps us discover what specific network interface card a packet is being sent too
	requests allow us to form tables so we can map ports to different MAC addresses and send specific packets to specific MAC addresses
	layer 2
	man in the middle attack
	ARP poisoning


Port Communication Endpoints
	> allow for multiple applications to use net connections 
	reserved by programs and applications
	65 535 ports per net connection
	defaults can be changed
	ports communicate over TCP/UDP 
	layer 4
