IP Addresses
	This lesson focuses on how IP addresses fit into the OSI Model.
	IP addresses are logically mapped addresses that map to a physical address.
	IP addresses aren’t mapped to a computer and can be mapped to any MAC we want, they can change and move.
	They are not hard encoded and are set statically.
	An IP address is a 32-bit binary address and is divided into four sections called octets, this is because each section has eight numbers.
	Participants learn how to calculate octets using a specific numerical sequence, starting with one and incrementing our way up by powers of 2.

APIPA	> Automatic Private IP Address
	169.254.0.0 to 169.254.255.255
	when DHCP is unavailable
	which is not good

	This lesson covers APIPA which stands for Automatic Private Internet Protocol Addressing.
	APIPA is an address which is automatically assigned to our IP address when no DHCP is received.
	When an APIPA address is received, it means something is wrong and the DHCP server needs to be checked to see any issues with connectivity.
	An APIPA address is unable to connect to the Internet and is unable to communicate with other computers.
	This lesson also covers public and private IP addresses.
	A public IP address is a singularly unique address for a computer that could be located anywhere in the world and is globally routable,
	whereas a private IP address is an address that is not routable. 


Private IPs

Class A	10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
	255.0.0.0 ( /8 )

Class B	172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
	255.240.0.0 ( /12 )

Class C	192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255
	255.255.0.0 ( /16 )


CIDR	> Classless Inter-Domain Routing
	CIDR allows us to have variable-length subnet masks.
	Subnet masks within CIDR are not within the standard classes of A,B or C 
	and CIDR notation is used when standard subnet masks do not work and allows us to break up subnet masks and work with IP addresses.


IPv4 vs IPv6
	AN IPV4 is a 32-bit address scheme, meaning it has 32 binary bits of data which are divided into four octets (sets of 8).
	This provides us with 4 billion addresses which should be enough, in theory.
	However, now we are running out with so many devices that connect to the Internet.
	That’s where IPV6 comes in, which provides us with a 128-bit address which provides trillions of addresses.
	Participants also learn about hexadecimals to determine binary values for IPV6 addresses.

IPv4
	32 bit
	4 octets
	4 billion addresses

IPv6
	128 bit
	3.4×10^38 (340 trillion trillion trillion)
	emit leading 0

IPv6 Address representation

	The 128 bits of an IPv6 address are represented in 8 groups of 16 bits each.
	Each group is written as four hexadecimal digits and the groups are separated by colons (:).
	An example of this representation is 2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:ff00:0042:8329.

	For convenience, an IPv6 address may be abbreviated to shorter notations by application of the following rules.

	One or more leading zeroes from any groups of hexadecimal digits are removed; 
	this is usually done to either all or none of the leading zeroes. For example, the group 0042 is converted to 42.
	Consecutive sections of zeroes are replaced with a double colon (::). 
	The double colon may only be used once in an address, as multiple use would render the address indeterminate.
	RFC 5952 recommends that a double colon must not be used to denote an omitted single section of zeroes.[38]
	An example of application of these rules:

	Initial address: 2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:ff00:0042:8329
	After removing all leading zeroes in each group: 2001:db8:0:0:0:ff00:42:8329
	After omitting consecutive sections of zeroes: 2001:db8::ff00:42:8329
	The loopback address, 0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001, may be abbreviated to ::1 by using both rules.


MAC	> Media Access Control
	Physical address of Network Interface Card
	Unique Worldwide
	Layer 2 - Data Link
	Hexadecimal Format
	AA:AA:AA:AA:AA:AA
	
	Used in:
	DNS
	ARP
	DHCP

	MAC addresses allow us to make data link connections as well as point to point connections that are not routed through any router.


Subnetting
	First - Network ID (Even)
	Last - Broadcast (Odd)
	First usable = NetID + 1
	Last usable = Next NetID -2

	IP:		192.168.1.37/28		192.168.10.0/25
	SM:		255.255.255.240		255.255.255.128
	Extra Bits:	4			1
	Host Bits Off:	4			7
	(256) - N:	240			128
	NetID:		32			0
	Broadcast:	47			127
	Usable Addr:	33-46			1-126
	Net Increment:	16			128


Unicast
	IPv4 > 1 to 1
	IPv6 > Linklocal, Sitelocal, Uniquelocal, Global unicast
	A single computer (or node) talking to another single computer (or node)

Multicast
	IPv4 > 1 to many
	IPv6 > 1 to many (use with anycast to replace broadcast)
	One computer (or node) talking to many computers (or nodes)

Broadcast (IPv4)
	Broadcast to all in broadcast domain
	One computer (or node) to anyone of anything in the broadcast domain, can be reached just by talking to the MAC address
Anycast (IPv6)
	Anycast to nearest/closest
