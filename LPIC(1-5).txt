02 - Integrated Hardware Devices
	$lsmod - show status of modules
	$modprobe < > - add and remove modules from kernel
	/dev/
	everything is a file
	files are pointers to devices
	hard drives and partitions

03 - Removable Devices
	hot plug - to go
	cold plug - can't be plug on unplug while pc is running
	$lsusb - list usb devices
	$usb-devices
	$lspci - list pci devices
	$dmesg - print or control the kernel ring buffer

04 - Dealing with Devices
	proc - is the old one, it is more or less without rules and structure.
		And at some point it was decided that proc was a little too chaotic and a new way was needed.

	sysfs - created, and the new stuff that was added was put into sysfs like device information.

	So in some sense they do the same, but sysfs is a little bit more structured.
	
05 - Linux Boot Process and Initrd
	BIOS/UEFI > MBR > GRUB > Initrd > Kernel
	
	BIOS
		Power On Self Test
		activates onboard hardware
		turns things over to boot device
	MBR
		512bytes of first HD sector
		contains bootloader(grub) and partition info
	GRUB
		now GRUB2
		replaces LILO
		runs from mbr but can access hard drive
		launches kernel or initrd
	Initrd
		initial ram disk
		solves problen of 'kitchen sink' kernels
		minimal linux kernel, which simply detects what kernel modules to load
		then hands off to manin kernel
		able to mount harddisks
	Kernel
		kernel loads
		starts init process...
			init is the program which starts all other programs
