Physical	> eletrical
		cables and bits
		wireless data travelling back and forth
		things that can be hold
		NIC
		voltage
		pinouts
		cable specifications

Data Link	> access
		physical addressing
		access to a computer
		access to a device
		package bits/data into frames
		MAC address
		transfer from point to point
		taking packets and sending out to diffent computers
		(Frames are segments of data that we are pushing over layer 2 connectivity. 
		It is a transfer from point to point and MAC addresses.)
		
Network		> ip layer
		path
		routing
		assigns/converts MAC address to IP address
		transferring data through one to more networks
		looking at ipdresses then sending them to different destinations
		fragmentation/reassembly
		packets
		routers
		logical addresses are translates into physical and network routing

Transport	> management/control
		transfer of data
		split communications into packages
		making sure where it needs to go
		helps to transfer data that we send and receive
		verification or no verification of delivery
		TCP(receipt)
		UDP(no verify)
		

Session		> traffic control
		traffic control layer
		shipping manager
		session
		controls connections between computers
		coordinates conversations
		connections are established, managed and terminated
		regulates when computer can send when, what, how much

Presentation	> formats data
		encryption/decryption
		translates applications into data so it can be understood and displayed by the application layer

Application	> network access
		enables apps to access network
		identify communication partners
		determine resources available
		helps to synchronize communications
		includes: SMTP, HTTP, FTP
